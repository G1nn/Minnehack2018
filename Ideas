1. an app with small games testing how drunk you are

2. a healthy habit goal app - "I bet you can't do this" with a currency system.
One can post a goal (quit drinking coke for a week) and put in a certain amount of currency (let's say ... peach).
And others can bet on that and put in money. If the goal is reached, the op gets all the peaches from the participants;
if op fails, the participants splits the peaches that the op put in.
